### Multi-Vendor Restaurant Platform

This project is a multi-vendor restaurant platform built using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). The platform allows multiple vendors to sign up, create and manage their restaurant profiles, and list their products (dishes or meals). Customers can browse through various restaurants, view menus, and place orders directly from the platform.

#### Key Features:

- **Restaurant Dashboard**:  
  - **Menu Builder**: Vendors can easily create and manage their restaurant menus.
  - **Opening & Closing Hours**: Manage restaurant availability with custom schedules.
  - **Order Management**: View all received orders and track their status.
  - **Total Orders & Revenue**: Vendors can track their total orders and overall revenue.
  - **Monthly Revenue**: Monitor total revenue for the current month.

- **Customer Dashboard**:  
  - **Profile Settings**: Customers can manage their profiles and account details.
  - **Order History & Payments**: Easily access past orders and payment statuses.
  - **Order Summary**: View the total number of orders placed on the platform.

- **Payment Method**: Secure payment processing is integrated with PayPal.

- **API Integration**: Built with Django REST Framework (DRF) for seamless API communication between the frontend and backend.

- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, the platform is optimized for both desktop and mobile users.

- **Django Backend**: A robust backend to handle user authentication, order processing, and vendor management.

- **AJAX Functionality**: Improved user experience with AJAX-driven interactions for real-time updates.

This platform is ideal for entrepreneurs looking to launch a multi-vendor food marketplace with comprehensive vendor and customer management features.
