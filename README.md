## Multi-Vendor Restaurant Platform
This project is a multi-vendor restaurant platform built using Django. The platform allows multiple vendors to sign up, create and manage their restaurant profiles, and list their products (dishes or meals). Customers can browse through various restaurants, view menus, and place orders directly from the platform.

Key Features:
Vendor Management: Each vendor can manage their restaurant profile, menu, and orders through a dedicated dashboard.
Customer Interaction: Customers can explore restaurants, place orders, and leave reviews.
Payment Integration: Seamless integration with payment gateways like PayPal for secure transactions.
Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS, the platform is optimized for both desktop and mobile users.
Django Backend: A robust backend to handle user authentication, order processing, and vendor management.
AJAX Functionality: Improved user experience with AJAX-driven interactions for real-time updates.
This platform is ideal for entrepreneurs looking to launch a multi-vendor food marketplace with scalability and flexibility in mind.
